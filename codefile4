But I am happy that I never fake around them.
I just openely express whatever I feel.
I be myself,I am not wearing a mask and I am pretty sure about that.
And I am happy that I have that liberty of expressing my feelings around them without any hesitation.
Being an introvert,I think comfort zone is the most important thing with the people we like.I have that comfort zone with them.
